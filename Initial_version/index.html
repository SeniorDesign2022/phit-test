                    Benign prostatic hyperplasia, also known as prostate gland enlargement, 
                    could be a suitable disorder that could incorporate PROs in the course of its treatment. 
                    BPH is a urinary disorder that is common to men as they age, and causes multiple urinary symptoms, 
                    including but not limited to frequent urge to urinate, difficulty starting urination, weak urine stream, 
                    and inability to completely empty the bladder. If symptoms exacerbate, 
                    it could cause further problems in the urinary tract or the kidneys. BPH affects approximately one third 
                    of men older than 50 years and 90% of men by age 85 years. It is also documented that more than 14 million men in the United States have symptoms of BPH.

                    Patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures have emerged over the recent years 
                    with the goal of involving patients at the center of health care research, and improving their clinical 
                    experience. PROs can consist of any self-reported information from patients regarding their own health, 
                    quality of life, and physical or functional status after receiving treatment. PROMs refer to tools or devices 
                    that are used to record and report PROs (Weldring, 2013). In the past, PROs have been used more frequently for
                     diseases that are difficult to cure, such as cancers, because patientsâ€™ quality of life has a greater impact
                     on their experience when the cure is not always successful. Collecting PROs has multiple benefits. First, it could 
                     serve as an important indicator of treatment efficacy that is difficult to be solely captured by clinical assessments. It also enhances communication between the patient and the care provider, which allows for more accurate treatment planning, increased patient satisfaction, and improved patient compliance and retention
